# SoftwareDevelopment_FinalProject
This repository includes the answers for the 8 exercises of the Software Development 1 Project, as well as a spreadsheet with study cases for each one of the exercises.

In order for the exercises to work properly, its better if they are downloaded and placed in the same folder. The code can be compiled and ran by many different software like Textpad, for example.
